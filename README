You'll need /dev/snapshot for these to work:

crw-r--r--  1 root root 10, 231 Jan 13 21:21 /dev/snapshot

(see HOWTO file for more details).

Suspending to RAM should be done from the C program (not a
script). This will allow us to do suspend-to-both-RAM-and-disk in
future.

For debugging, see http://www.opensuse.org/ACPI_Suspend_debugging .

acpi-support package from Ubuntu has *very* long whitelist of machines: 
http://packages.ubuntu.org.cn/dapper/admin/acpi-support .

vbetool is based on vbetool-0.5-1 from Debian. pciutils-dev package is
needed to compile vbetool.
