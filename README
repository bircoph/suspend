The package contains the suspend and resume tools that make
it possible to use the kernel software suspend userland interface
(available in the 2.6.17-rc1 kernel and above).

You'll need /dev/snapshot for these to work:

crw-r--r--  1 root root 10, 231 Jan 13 21:21 /dev/snapshot

(see the HOWTO file for more details).

The suspend tool now supports the "suspend to both" option which
means the box may be suspended to RAM after the suspend to disk
image has been created instead of being powered off.  Then, if
there's enough battery power, you can resume from RAM and
discard the saved image.  However, this is only possible if your
box is explicitly whitelisted.

The s2ram utility is also provided allowing you to suspend to RAM
or just check if the box is on the whitelist.  The utility contains
the code out of vbetool and radeontool needed for handling quite a lot
of graphics cards after resume from RAM.

For debugging, see http://www.opensuse.org/ACPI_Suspend_debugging and
http://en.opensuse.org/S2ram .

acpi-support package from Ubuntu has *very* long whitelist of machines: 
http://packages.ubuntu.org.cn/dapper/admin/acpi-support .

The vbetool code is based on vbetool-0.5-1 from Debian.

pciutils-dev package is needed to compile the vbetool code, so it's needed
to compile the suspend and s2ram tools.
