This package contains some userland tools allowing you to suspend a Linux
system either to disk or to RAM.  These tools provide some capabilities
that are not available in the vanilla Linux kernel.

The suspend to disk can be carried out with the help of s2disk and resume
utilities which use the software suspend userland interface available in
the Linux kernel 2.6.17 or above.  Among other things, they provide the
following features:

- suspend image checksumming
- suspend image compression
- suspend image encryption
- (limited) support for splash screens and graphical progress meters

that are not provided by the in-kernel software suspend code (swsusp).
Please refer to the HOWTO document in this package for more information about
these utilities and installation instructions.

The s2ram tool allows you to suspend the system to RAM and restore the state
of the graphics adapter after the resume automatically.  For this purpose it
uses the code out of vbetool and radeontool utilities, needed for handling
quite a lot of graphics cards after the resume from RAM.  It also contains a
whitelist of machines that are known to work with it.  Please refer to the
document README.s2ram-whitelist in this package for more information about the
s2ram whitelist.

The s2both tool combines the functionalities of s2disk and s2ram.  With the
help of it the system may be suspended to RAM after the suspend-to-disk
image has been created instead of being powered off.  Then, if there's enough
battery power, you can resume from RAM and discard the saved image, or you
can resume the system from disk using the resume tool otherwise  However, this
is only possible if your box is present in the s2ram whitelist.

To build the s2ram and s2both tools you will need the pciutils-devel
(pciutils-dev) package which is necessary to compile the vbetool code
(the vbetool code is based on vbetool-0.6-1.1 from Debian).

For debugging, see http://www.opensuse.org/ACPI_Suspend_debugging and
http://en.opensuse.org/S2ram .

acpi-support package from Ubuntu has *very* long whitelist of machines: 
http://packages.ubuntu.org.cn/dapper/admin/acpi-support that are likely to
work with s2ram.
